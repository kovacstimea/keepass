== Welcome
KeePassXC is a modern open-source password manager. It is used to store and manage information such as URLs, usernames, passwords, and so on for various accounts on your web applications. KeePassXC stores all data in an encrypted format while still providing secure access to your information.

KeePassXC is helpful for people with extremely high demands of secure personal data management. It saves many different information, such as user names, passwords, URLs, attachments, and comments in one single database. For a better management, user-defined titles and icons can be specified for different entries in KeePassXC. In addition, the entries are sorted in customizable groups. The integrated search function allows to search in a single group or the complete database.

KeePassXC also provides a secure, customizable, fast, and easy-to-use password generator utility. This utility is very helpful to those who generate passwords frequently.

=== Overview
You can store an unlimited number of passwords and information in a KeePassXC database. Every piece of information you store in your database is encrypted at all times within the `kdbx` file. When you are accessing your database from within KeePassXC, your information in decrypted and stored in your computer's memory. KeePassXC places controls over the access to this data so other applications cannot read it (unless they have administrative rights). The interface is designed to let you quickly access your passwords, search for the right entry, perform Auto-Type or copy/paste
operations, make and save changes, and then get out of your way.

KeePassXC ships with light and dark themes specifically designed to meet accessibility standards. In most cases, the appropriate theme for your system will be determined automatically, but you can always set a specific theme in the application settings.
